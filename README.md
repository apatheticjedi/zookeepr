## Description

This is a project that was completed for class. It was designed to gain experience in back end development, particularly setting up a web server using Express.js, handling GET and POST requests, and deploying an application to Heroku. This is a fictional Zoo Animal Catalog that allows users to view or add animals and zookeepers to the database. [View the deployed application here](https://infinite-journey-99980.herokuapp.com/).
